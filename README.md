# FlightGearSimulator_AutoPilot
Connecting to an open source code "Flight Gear" which is a flight simulator.
In the project I use multiple threads in order to recieve data from the simulator and sending command to the simulator to change the value of the variables in it and make it take off.
The project include exept from multithreading Command Design Pattern, Object Addapter Dessign Pattern, and a Client Server communication.
Furthermore it also use an interpreter that I created that interpret a text file (and command line commands) into code that can be executed.
